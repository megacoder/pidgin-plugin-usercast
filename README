Pigdin user casting plugin

Latest version of the plugin is available at:
https://github.com/santa01/usercast

Usercast copies the nickname you've double clicked in the conference chat and
pastes it into a conversation's entry field. Plugin requires pidgin development
package to be installed (which usually pulls is libpurple dev package, as well
as glib and gtk+).
